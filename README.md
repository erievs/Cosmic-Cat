## NeoCat 

- Why this fork?

Comsic cat has some issue i've noticed, I decied I will try to
add them in and patch them!

## Changes Between Regular Cosmic-Cat YT

- Show info works (It was very easy all I had to do was give it an id and log it)

- Replies work (mostly) currently comments are borken you are not able to post them in my test case
so I am waiting for them to be fixed. Or maybe i'll figure it out my self.

## Where are the changes in the source code?

They are all found at the end of the code all elements I added I changed evs will be in its ids.

## Why this repo?

Unfortunately, Cosmic Cat Extension was discontinued by the creator Emiri Floarea. So I make this continuation.

I will try to support as much as possible, but I do not know Javascript. So, I will not be able to provide good support.
If you know Javascript, please help out.

In the very first release, I simply changed URL in the code to become permanent, so it does not break when the creator deletes the resources.

### Q&A

#### Will the official Cosmic Cat stop working?

The official Cosmic Cat will stop working after 2023-10-31 Halloween's day, because the creator will delete the resource's website.
So I am recommending to use our "cosmic-cat-yt" fork of the Cosmic Cat until then.

#### Are you the new developers of Cosmic Cat?

Cosmic Cat is authored by Emiri Floarea. Thank you to her that it is here.

But also, since Cosmic Cat is discontinued by the original creator, I made this fork, so people could continue to use it.
This "cosmic-cat-yt" organization, we will continue to develop the user script.
